I won't ask a question, I'll state the truth
It's everything I know and all I do
There's people better off, they're just like you
But no one is someone until I tell them who
This is the way that it is
This is the way that it always will be
Something you love turns to something you miss
Something you say turns to something you mean
This is the way that I know
This is the way and it makes me sick
I feel it inside me like a pulse
It's starting to slow and the meter dips, oh
Why don't you get it? Can't you get it? Understand
They're gonna execute the mother to elevate the man
They're gonna propagate the killer, eliminate the youth
They're gonna blind date everyone until you love them too
They're gonna blind date everyone until you love them too
They're gonna blind date everyone until you love them too
They're gonna blind date everyone until you love them
